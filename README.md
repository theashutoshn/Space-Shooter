# Space-Shooter

As a Junior Unity Developer, I worked on creating a 2D Shooter game to enhance my skills in Unity C# programming, game mechanics, and 2D game development. This project serves as a learning experience and a showcase of my abilities in developing engaging and interactive gameplay.

1. Set up the Unity project and created essential assets.

2. Developed player control scripts for smooth movement and shooting mechanics.

3. Implemented enemy AI with basic movement and attack patterns.

4. Designed multiple levels with increasing difficulty and various environments.

5. Integrated power-ups and weapon upgrades for added gameplay depth.
